0.0.2
-----
Upgraded things to a proper pip-installable project.
Added tests.
Factored NaturalCubicSpline apart into natural_cubic_spline_coeffs and NaturalCubicSpline, so that using splines is easier with PyTorch's functionality with things like DataLoaders.

0.0.1
-----
This version wasn't actually even labelled! But since we're making an update then I might as well label it now.
This version introduced the NaturalCubicSpline class.
