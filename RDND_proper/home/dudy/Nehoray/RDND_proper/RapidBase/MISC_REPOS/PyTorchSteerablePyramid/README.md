# Complex Steerable Pyramid in PyTorch

This is a PyTorch implementation of the Complex Steerable Pyramid described in [Portilla and Simoncelli (IJCV, 2000)](http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~lcv/pubs/makeAbs.php?loc=Portilla99). 

It uses PyTorch's efficient spectral decomposition layers `torch.fft` and `torch.ifft`. Just like a normal convolution layer, the complex steerable pyramid expects a batch of images of shape `[N,C,H,W]` with current support only for grayscale images (`C=1`). It returns a `list` structure containing the low-pass, high-pass and intermediate levels of the pyramid for each image in the batch (as `torch.Tensor`). Computing the steerable pyramid is significantly faster on the GPU as can be observed from the runtime benchmark below.

## Usage

In addition to the PyTorch implementation defined in `SCFpyr_PyTorch` the original SciPy version is also included in `SCFpyr` for completeness and comparison. As the GPU implementation highly benefits from parallelization, the `cwt` and `power` methods expect signal batches of shape `[N,H,W]` containing a batch of `N` images of shape `HxW`.

```python
from steerable.SCFpyr_PyTorch import SCFpyr_PyTorch
import RapidBase.PyTorchSteerablePyramid.steerable.utils as utils

# Load batch of images [N,1,H,W]
im_batch_numpy = utils.load_image_batch(...)
im_batch_torch = torch.from_numpy(im_batch_numpy).to(device)

# Requires PyTorch with MKL when setting to 'cpu' 
device = torch.device('cuda:0')

# Initialize Complex Steerbale Pyramid
pyr = SCFpyr_PyTorch(height=5, nbands=4, scale_factor=2, device=device)

# Decompose entire batch of images 
coeff = pyr.build(im_batch_torch)

# Reconstruct batch of images again
im_batch_reconstructed = pyr.reconstruct(coeff)

# Visualization
coeff_single = utils.extract_from_batch(coeff, 0)
coeff_grid = utils.make_grid_coeff(coeff, normalize=True)
cv2.imshow('Complex Steerable Pyramid', coeff_grid)
cv2.waitKey(0)
```

## Benchmark

Performing parallel the CSP decomposition on the GPU using PyTorch results in a significant speed-up. Increasing the batch size will give faster runtimes. The plot below shows a comprison between the `scipy` versus `torch` implementation as function of the batch size `N` and input signal length. These results were obtained on a powerful Linux desktop with NVIDIA Titan X GPU.

## Installation

Clone and install:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tomrunia/PyTorchSteerablePyramid.git
cd PyTorchSteerablePyramid
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

## Requirements

- Python 2.7 or 3.6 (other versions might also work)
- Numpy (developed with 1.15.4)
- Scipy (developed with 1.1.0)
- PyTorch >= 0.4.0 (developed with 1.0.0; see note below)

The steerable pyramid depends utilizes `torch.fft` and `torch.ifft` to perform operations in the spectral domain. At the moment, PyTorch only implements these operations for the GPU or with the MKL back-end on the CPU. Therefore, if you want to run the code on the CPU you might need to compile PyTorch from source with MKL enabled. Use `torch.backends.mkl.is_available()` to check if MKL is installed.
